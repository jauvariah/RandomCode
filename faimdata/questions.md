1. Given two strings with different length, write a function to check if the characters in the shorter string are all included in the longer string

e.g. 

longer ABEFSAS
shorter BAFS

return true

longer ABEFSAS
shorter BAFSZ <- because we have a Z

return false

2. Given a long integer array, find the integer which appears for more than N/2 times, where N is the array length.
Bonus: What if you want constant space complexity?

3. 
Given a matrix containing integers, the dimension of which is M * N, for each row and column the elements are sorted in ascending order, please find an algorithm to find a given value x in the matrix. Try to optimize the time complexity with your best effort

20  50  60
