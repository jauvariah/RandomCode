We want to write a program to represent the concept of friendship.
Please implement the following methods for this concept along with
unit tests in your preferred language and email me back with what is
completed in two hours from agreed upon start time (or earlier if completed sooner) 
with the files or a link to a gist or github location.

Please feel free to call or text me with questions while working: 510 225 5655.


method name: makeFriend
method return type: void
method parameters: name1 of type string, name2 of type string
   // This method takes 2 string parameters and
   // makes them a "friend" of each other.
   //
   // Note: The order of names does not matter
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage for this


method name:   unmakeFriend
method return type: void
method parameters: name1 of type string, name2 of type string
   // This method takes 2 String parameters and
   // makes them no longer friends of each other.
   //
   // Note: The order of names does not matter
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage for this


method name:   getDirectFriends
method return type: collection of string names
method parameters: name of type string
   // This method takes a single argument (name) and
   // returns all the immediate "friends" of that name as an array of strings
   //
   // For example, A & B are friends, B & C are friends and C & D are friends.
   // getDirectFriends(B) would return A and C
   // getDirectFriends(D) would return C
   //
   // Note: It should not return duplicate names
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage for this


method name:   getIndirectFriends
method return type: collection of string names
method parameters: name of type string
   // This method takes a single argument (name) and
   // returns all the indirect "friends" of that name as an array of strings
   //
   // For example, A & B are friends, B & C are friends and C & D are friends.
   // getInirectFriends(A) would return C and D
   //
   // Note: It should not return duplicate names
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage
for this getIndirectFriends(name)


Please implement unit tests with your solution.  Here is one example
of a unit test to implement, but please add more:

method name: testGetDirectFriends
method return type: void
method parameters: void
 // Create a new friendship
 // call makeFriend on "Aaron" and "Bella"
 // call makeFriend on "Bella" and "Cindy"
 // call makeFriend on "Bella" and "David"
 // call makeFriend on "David" and "Elizabeth"
 // call makeFriend on "Cindy" and "Frank"
 // call getDirectFriends with "David" as the argument
 // assert that David's direct friends are "Bella" and "Elizabeth"

Please note:

* getIndirectFriends isn’t just 1 level of indirection, but goes
down the chain (If A and B are friends, and B and C, and C and D,
getIndirectFriends(A) not only returns C but also D).

* feel free to add any new methods or classes to help implement the
given methods.

* please use asserts in unit tests, focus on unit testing
getIndirectFriends(), and add tests for the other methods as time
permits.
