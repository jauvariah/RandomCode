We want to write a program to represent the concept of friendship.
Please implement the following methods for this concept along with
unit tests in your preferred language in two hours


method name: makeFriend
method return type: void
method parameters: name1 of type string, name2 of type string
   // This method takes 2 string parameters and
   // makes them a "friend" of each other.
   //
   // Note: The order of names does not matter
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage for this


method name:   unmakeFriend
method return type: void
method parameters: name1 of type string, name2 of type string
   // This method takes 2 String parameters and
   // makes them no longer friends of each other.
   //
   // Note: The order of names does not matter
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage for this


method name:   getDirectFriends
method return type: collection of string names
method parameters: name of type string
   // This method takes a single argument (name) and
   // returns all the immediate "friends" of that name as an array of strings
   //
   // For example, A & B are friends, B & C are friends and C & D are friends.
   // getDirectFriends(B) would return A and C
   // getDirectFriends(D) would return C
   //
   // Note: It should not return duplicate names
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage for this


method name:   getIndirectFriends
method return type: collection of string names
method parameters: name of type string
   // This method takes a single argument (name) and
   // returns all the indirect "friends" of that name as an array of strings
   //
   // For example, A & B are friends, B & C are friends and C & D are friends.
   // getInirectFriends(A) would return C and D
   //
   // Note: It should not return duplicate names
   // Note: Don't forget to write tests to have good test coverage
for this getIndirectFriends(name)


Please implement unit tests with your solution.  Here is one example
of a unit test to implement, but please add more:

method name: testGetDirectFriends
method return type: void
method parameters: void
 // Create a new friendship
 // call makeFriend on "Aaron" and "Bella"
 // call makeFriend on "Bella" and "Cindy"
 // call makeFriend on "Bella" and "David"
 // call makeFriend on "David" and "Elizabeth"
 // call makeFriend on "Cindy" and "Frank"
 // call getDirectFriends with "David" as the argument
 // assert that David's direct friends are "Bella" and "Elizabeth"

Please note:

* getIndirectFriends isnâ€™t just 1 level of indirection, but goes
down the chain (If A and B are friends, and B and C, and C and D,
getIndirectFriends(A) not only returns C but also D).

* feel free to add any new methods or classes to help implement the
given methods.

* please use asserts in unit tests, focus on unit testing
getIndirectFriends(), and add tests for the other methods as time
permits.
