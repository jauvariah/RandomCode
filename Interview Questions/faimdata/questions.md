#Computer Science Questions
1. Given two strings with different length, write a function to check if the characters in the shorter string are all included in the longer string
	Sample:
	Input: _longer_ ABEFSAS, _shorter_ BAFS
	Output: true

	Input: _longer_ ABEFSAS, _shorter_ BAFSZ
	Output: false

2. Given a long integer array, find the integer which appears for more than N/2 times, where N is the array length.
Bonus: What if you want constant space complexity?

3. Given a matrix containing integers, the dimension of which is M * N, for each row and column the elements are sorted in ascending order, please find an algorithm to find a given value x in the matrix. Try to optimize the time complexity with your best effort
