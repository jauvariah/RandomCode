1.3 Get the slop of each line. Would intersect if different. 

1.4 Draw a line through the center of these squares

1.10 

4.1 (3+1)/3*6 = 8

4.2 	      Fill 3 quart jug, pour into 5 quart jug.
	      Fill 3 quart jug, pour 2 quart into 5 quart jug. 1 quart leftover
	      Dump 5 quart jug, pour 1 quart into 5 quart jug.
	      Fill 3 quart jug, pour into 5 quart jug. 4 quarts in the 5 quart jug

4.3 Start from floor 14, upon survival, step up 13 floor, repeat for 12, and so on. Worst case scenario 14 attempts. 

4.4 All of them jump into the water at midnight. 

4.5 Lockers with perfect squares are open

5.1 In C++ structs and classes are pretty much the same. Access modifier for member variables, methods, and for base classes in class defaults to private, access modifier in structs default to public. In C, a strcut is just an aggregate collection of public data, and has no other class like features: methods, consturctors, base class etc. 

5.4 Virtual function is a function that can be overriden within an inheriting class of the same signature. 

6.1 n = 6, k = 3, 6 choose 3, n!/(n-k)!(k!) = 20

7.2 Inner Join: Result joint table only has record where keys exist on both tables. 
    Left Join: Result joint table only has record where keys exist on the left table
    Right Join: Result joint table only has record where keys exist on the right table
    Outer Join: Result joint table has all records, where keys that don't exist on the left or right table will have record of null.
