5. The two observations that I have made are, int types only will take positive and negative integers. When assigning a extraordinarily large integer to the_int variable, the compiler will disregard such assignment. 
When assigning invalid strings into the_double variable, the compiler will also bypass the assignment.
When assigning two separate numbers with a space to the_int variable, the first number will be assigned to the_int and the second number will be assigned to the_double.
